DISCO:
- When making an HTTP request using our API key, this pops up on the dev console:
DevTools failed to load source map: Could not load content for chrome-extension://bmnlcjabgnpnenekpadlanbbkooimhnj/browser-polyfill.js.map: System error: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT

- When we try to click on the chrome extension that failed to load, it says that the file cannot be found

- One thing to note is that while we got an error msg in the dev console for both macOS and Unix, we're not sure if they are the same error/failure across all operating systems.

QCC:
- My api key works fine when we paste it into the url, but it says it is not registered when doing so with Flask. Why is this?
- Why is the "source map" referring to and why is it failing to load?
- Why is the source map significant?
- Why does the url change during multiple HTTP requests, even though the image displayed at the urls remains the same?
