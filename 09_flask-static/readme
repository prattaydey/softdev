Notes:
When opening the webpage of a file with extension:
none -> download
.txt -> displays contents on webpage
.html -> displays contents on webpage
.py -> displays contents on webpage
.java -> download

In order to see the contents of a webpage, you must first establish a connection between your server and the page. In the case of a python file, this can be done with the python3 <file>.py command in terminal.
However, in this case how does running app.py establish a connection between the web browser and other files such as foo and foo.html, even though they're in a separate folder and different file types?
