DISCO
- There are different html input types
- Input types:
  ~ "text" - creates a text input field
  ~ "email" - creates a text input field, but requires that certain email criteria be met ("@" symbol, ".com", etc.)
  ~ "password" - creates a text input field, but replaces chars with dots
  ~ "image" - allows user to upload an image file
  ~ "textarea" - creates an adjustable textbox
- "<localhost>/auth" is where you are brought when you submit the form

QCC:
- Where do we put "methods=['GET', 'POST']"?
- why does everything break when we uncomment the commented-out sections
- request.args['username']???
