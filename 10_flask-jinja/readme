Q0: What will happen if you remove render_template from this line? (log your prediction before you pull the trigger...)
    Prediction - Some type of error or failure to connect will show up when we are trying to connect to /my_foist_template

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
    Instead of the root directory, it will be http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template

Q2: What is the significance of each argument? Simplest, most concise answer best.
    render_template( 'model_tmplt.html', foo="fooooo", collection=coll)
    1st argument - sets the template that app route returns
    2nd argument - sets the title of the page
    3rd argument - sets the collection of numbers that will be printed out


DISCO:
 - `import render_template` is the jinja engine which, hence its name, renders the templates we create
 - "No hablo queso!" Prints in the root directory, as predicted
 - the URL for the "test_tmplt" page will most likely be "<localhost>/my_foist_template"
 - first arg of `render_template` takes the template that we want to render
 - following args are just vars in the template we want to pass in values for

QCC:
 - "render_template" ... what it do?
 - jinja for loop??!!
 - can we create our own templates and load them in our own specified URLs??
