                    Once upon a time, a young Devo reached the age where he needed his own set of keys to get into the house. Attached to the keys was a peculiar yellow bear with a strong liking for honey. Winnie loves to socialize with others, but his attempts to do so with Purple are not very successful as Purple would rather sleep. Winnie still persists in his attempts because it is not in his nature to get discouraged.

                    A Devo once fell asleep at his keyboard, and because the sleep was so good that keyboard turned into purple. Purple likes decisive and direct action and Winni's tendency to bumble irritates him.
