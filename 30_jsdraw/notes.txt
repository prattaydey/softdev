DISCO
- There is no circle function built into js and you need to use the arc() function
- clearRect() doesn't mean clear rectangles but rather clear this rectangle area (specified by parameter)
- offsetX/offsetY provides the x/y coordinates

QCC
- What does stroke do? Adding it when drawing out the circle doesn't seem to do anything
