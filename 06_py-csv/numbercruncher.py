DISCO:
- When reading csv files, we can use DictReader() instead of reader(). This function is like a regular reader but also maps each row to a key-value pair.

QCC:

HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:

'''

import csv

with open("occupations.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row["Job Class"], row["Percentage"])
